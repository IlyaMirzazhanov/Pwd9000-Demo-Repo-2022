# Why I choosed Go.

Go is good language for web applications and in case of my app it's perfectly fine.

# Main advantages of the Go:

* Language is always in development
* It is used by many open-source and commercial projects
* It will be supported for many years

# Usage
Build using: go build
Run using: ./main

# Unit Tests
Added simple unit tests to check if app is running.

## Best practices:
* Run Your Test Suite Regularly - to check if app is ok
* Simple code structue - not too complex, not too
* Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases (DAMP)
